## Using C\+\+ DLL in VB


</div>

### Description

Wanna know how to use those functions you just wrote in C++ in VB using a DLL? Here ya go!
 
### More Info
 
The zip file holds two projects, one for VB6 (called 'UseDLL') and one for MSVC++6 (called 'DLLTest'). After compiling the C++ project and placing the resulting DLL into your 'system32' directory, you should be able to run the VB project that calls functions from DLL!

Note that the VB project is pre-compiled, where the DLL is in code form only.
